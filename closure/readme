Closure is when a function "remembers" its lexical scope even whwn is executed outside that lexical scope

A closure is referred to as an inner function having access to the variables in the outer function’s scope chain. 
The closure has accesses to three scoped variables:

1. Variables in their own scope
2. Variables in the function’s scope
3. Global variables
