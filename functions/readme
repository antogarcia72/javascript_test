There are two ways of creating functions in JavaScript.

1. Function Declaration
2. Function Expression

1. Function Declaration: it defines the function with the specified parameters.

Syntax: 
    function name(paramater1, parameter2,…) {
        Statement block
        .
        .
        .
    }

Function declarations hoist the definitions and therefore you can use these functions even before they are declared. 
This behavior holds valid if your functions are declared inside the global or the functional scope which is also known 
as Local Scope in JS. Never use function declarations inside conditional blocks.

2. Function Expression: The keyword “function” is used to define a function within a function.

Syntax: 
    const myFunc= function [name] (parameter1, parameter2, ….) {
        [ statements] 
    }
    
Where [name] is an optional parameter.
As a result of which these are anonymous functions.
